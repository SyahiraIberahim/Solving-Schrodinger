The time-independent Schrödinger equation describes the quantum behavior of particles confined in potential wells. However, analytical solutions only exist for simple potentials (e.g., infinite square well, harmonic oscillator). For more complex systems, numerical methods are required to approximate energy eigenvalues and wave functions.

This project implements a finite difference method in Python to solve the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation. 

 -Discretized the equation into a matrix form and solved it as an eigenvalue problem. 
 
 -Used NumPy for numerical computation and Matplotlib for visualization of wave functions and probability densities. 
 
 -Designed the code to accept different potential energy profiles (e.g., infinite well, finite well, harmonic oscillator).
 
 -Stored and version-controlled the project on GitHub for documentation, reproducibility, and collaboration.
 

 Results:

 -Successfully obtained quantized energy levels and corresponding normalized wave functions for selected potential wells.

 -Verified results against theoretical analytical values with minimal numerical error.

 -Produced clear visual plots showing how wave functions vary with potential shapes and energy states.
